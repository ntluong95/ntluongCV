Currently, I am a MSc student in One Health at ULiege (Belgium). My research interests focus on infectious diseases modelling and management. More information can be found in my research projects.

Feel free to contact me if you need help in statistics for your academic or work related projects.

In my spare time I like to play sports, learn to code and write about statistics and its applications in R through my blog. I also enjoy reading nonfiction books on statistics.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.
